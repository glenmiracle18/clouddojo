      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The write-through caching strategy is the optimal solution for this scenario. With this approach, data is written simultaneously to both the cache (Amazon ElastiCache) and the database (Amazon RDS for MySQL) whenever a customer adds an item. This ensures perfect synchronization between the cache and database at all times, meeting the requirement that \"data in the cache must always match the data in the database.\" Unlike lazy loading, which only updates the cache when data is requested (potentially leading to stale data), or TTL-based strategies that expire cache entries after a set time, write-through provides immediate consistency. While this strategy may introduce slight write latency, it guarantees data integrity across the three-tier web application's cache and database layers."
