## 📝 Next Steps (Tomorrow's Tasks)

### 1. **Add Responsive Padding for Large Screens**
- **Task:** Add vertical padding wrapper for projects page on large screens
- **Files to modify:**
  - `/app/dashboard/labs/category/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - Possibly create a layout wrapper component
- **Approach:**
  - Add container with responsive padding
  - Use Tailwind breakpoints (lg:py-12, xl:py-16)
  - Apply to category page and all content within

### 2. **Admin UI - Project Creation Interface**
- **Goal:** Build comprehensive admin interface for creating projects
- **Features to implement:**

  #### Project Details Form:
  - Basic Info:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Category selection (multi-select)
    - Difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
    - Project type (Tutorial, Challenge, Assessment, Capstone)
    - Estimated time
    - Estimated cost
    - Prerequisites (array input)
    - Learning objectives (array input)
    - Key technologies (array input)
    - Premium toggle
    - Published toggle

  #### Media Upload:
  - Thumbnail image upload
  - Video URL input
  - Image gallery for project steps

  #### Project Steps Builder:
  - Add/remove/reorder steps
  - For each step:
    - Step number (auto-generated)
    - Title
    - Description
    - Instructions (rich text editor?)
    - Expected output
    - Validation criteria (array)
    - Media uploads (multiple images)
    - Step type (Instruction, Quiz, Validation, Reflection, Checkpoint)
    - Optional flag
    - Estimated time

  #### UI/UX Considerations:
  - Multi-step wizard or single-page form?
  - Drag-and-drop for step reordering
  - Live preview of project card
  - Image upload with preview
  - Auto-save functionality
  - Validation and error handling
  - Success toast on creation

  #### Suggested File Structure:
  ```
  /app/admin/projects/
    ├── page.tsx (projects list with edit/delete)
    ├── new/
    │   ├── page.tsx (create new project)
    │   └── components/
    │       ├── project-details-form.tsx
    │       ├── project-steps-builder.tsx
    │       ├── step-form.tsx
    │       └── media-uploader.tsx
    └── [id]/
        └── edit/
            └── page.tsx (edit existing project)
  ```

  #### API Routes Needed:
  - POST `/api/admin/projects` - Create project
  - PUT `/api/admin/projects/[id]` - Update project
  - DELETE `/api/admin/projects/[id]` - Delete project
  - POST `/api/admin/upload` - Upload images/media
  - GET `/api/project-categories` - Get categories for dropdown

---

## 💡 Notes & Considerations

### Current Limitations:
- Add/remove project functionality is frontend-only (needs API integration)
- Avatar stack uses placeholder data (needs real user data)
- Part number detection is basic regex (might need improvement)

### Future Enhancements:
- Real-time project progress updates
- User profiles in avatar stack on hover
- Project search within category
- Filter by difficulty/type within category
- Bookmark/favorite functionality
- Share project functionality
- Project completion certificates
